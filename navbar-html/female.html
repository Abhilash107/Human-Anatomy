        <h1>Female Anatomy</h1>
        <h2 id="head2">"Female anatomy includes the external genitals, or the vulva, and the internal reproductive organs, which include the ovaries and the uterus."</h2>
        <p>One major difference between males and females is their reproductive organs. Anatomy specific to females generally relates to sexual function, reproduction, and hormone control.</p>
        <p>Males and females have physically different sexual anatomy, but all sex organs come from the same bundle of cells during fetal development. A baby’s biological sex is determined at the moment the father’s sperm meets the mother’s egg.</p>

        <h2>External anatomy</h2>
        <p>The external female anatomy includes the pubis and the vulva. The following sections discuss these in more detail.</p>
        <h3>Mons pubis</h3>
        <p>The mons pubis, or public mound, is the fleshy area on the pelvic bone where females typically grow pubic hair.</p>
        <h3>Vulva</h3>
        <p>The vulva refers to the external parts of a female’s genitals. It consists of several parts, including the labia majora, the labia minora, and the glans clitoris.</p>
        <p>The list below provides more detail on these parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Labia majora.</b> These are the fleshy outer lips on either side of the vaginal opening. The word “labia” is Latin for “lips.” These outer lips usually grow pubic hair.</li>
            <li><b>Labia minora.</b> These are the inner lips. They sit inside the outer lips but can be varying sizes. In some females, for example, the inner lips extend beyond the outer lips.</li>
            <li><b>Clitoris.</b> The glans clitoris sits at the top of the vulva, located where the inner lips meet. It is usually around the size of a pea, though size varies from person to person. Only the tip of the clitoris is visible, but it has two shafts that extend into the body by as much as 5 inches. The clitoris contains many nerve endings that are very sensitive, especially during sexual stimulation.</li>
            <li><b>Clitoral hood.</b> The clitoral hood is the fold of skin that surrounds the head of the clitoris. It protects the clitoris from friction.</li>
            <li><b>Urethral opening.</b> The opening to the urethra sits above the vaginal opening. The urethra connects to the bladder, and the opening is where urine exits the body.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Internal anatomy</h2>
        <p>The internal female anatomy begins at the vagina, which is the canal that leads from the vulva to the uterus.</p>

        <p>The cervix separates the vagina from the uterus, and the fallopian tubes connect the ovaries with the uterus.</p>
            
        <p>The following sections discuss these organs in more detail.</p>
        <h3>Vagina</h3>
        <p>As mentioned above, the vagina is the canal that connects the vulva with the uterus. The opening to the vagina is part of the vulva.</p>
        <p>The vagina can vary in size, but the average length is about 2.5 to 3 inches. That said, it expands in length during arousal.</p>
        <p>It also contains special structures called Bartholin’s glands. These are two “pea-sizedTrusted Source” glands that sit on either side of the vaginal opening. These glands are responsible for secreting lubrication to keep the vaginal tissues from becoming too dry.</p>
        <h3>Cervix</h3>
        <p>The cervix is the lower portion of the uterus. It is a cylinder-shaped area of tissue that separates the vagina from the rest of the uterus.</p>
        <p>During birth, the cervix dilates to allow the baby to move through the vagina.</p>
        <h3>Uterus</h3>

        <p class="caption">The uterus holds the fetus during pregnancy.</p>
        <p>The uterus is located in the middle of the pelvic cavity. This muscular sac will house the fetus during pregnancy.</p>
        <p>During a female’s monthly menstrual cycle, the lining of the uterus thickens with blood in preparation for the release of an egg from one of the ovaries. This is to prepare a nourishing environment for a fetus if pregnancy occurs.</p>
        <p>If pregnancy does not occur, the uterine lining sheds. This is called the menstrual period. It occurs every around 28 days, though cycle length varies between females.</p>
        <h2 class="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>The female body contains many organs that work together to achieve a variety of functions.</p>

        <p>The shape and size of many of these organs naturally vary from person to person. However, if a female is concerned that any part of their anatomy might not be “normal,” they can talk to their doctor.</p>
