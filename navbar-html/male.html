        <h1>Male Anatomy</h1>
        <p>One major difference between males and females is their reproductive organs. Anatomy specific to females
            generally relates to sexual function, reproduction, and hormone control.</p>
        <p>The following is an overview of the male reproductive anatomy:</p>
        <div class="table">
            <p><b>Scrotum.</b> The bag of skin that holds and helps to protect the testicles. The testicles make sperm
                and, to do this, the temperature of the testicles needs to be cooler than the inside of the body. This
                is why the scrotum is located outside of the body.</p>
            <div class="attachment">
                <p><b>Testes (testicles).</b> The testes are 2 small organs that are found inside the scrotum. The
                    testes are responsible for making sperm and are also involved in producing a hormone called
                    testosterone. Testosterone is an important hormone during male development and maturation for
                    developing muscles, deepening the voice, and growing body hair.</p>

            <p><b>Epididymis.</b> A long tube that is located near each testicle. The epididymis is the tube which moves
                the sperm from the testicles.</p>
            <p><b>Vas deferens.</b> This is a tube in which the sperm is stored and it carries the sperm out of the
                scrotal sac. The vas deferens is between the epididymis and the urethra and connects these together.</p>
            <p><b>Seminal vesicles.</b> The sac-like glands that lie behind the bladder and release a fluid that forms
                part of semen.</p>
            <p><b>Prostate gland.</b> It is about the size of a walnut, and surrounds the neck of the bladder and
                urethraâ€”the tube that carries urine from the bladder. It is partly muscular and partly glandular with
                ducts opening into the prostatic portion of the urethra. It is made up of 3 lobes: a center lobe with 1
                lobe on each side. The prostate gland secretes a slightly alkaline fluid that forms part of the seminal
                fluid, a fluid that carries sperm.</p>
            <p><b>Urethra.</b> This is a tube that allows urine to flow outside the body. It is also the channel for
                semen to pass during ejaculation. The brain signals the bladder muscles to tighten. This squeezes urine
                out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincter muscles to relax to let urine exit
                the bladder through the urethra. When all the signals happen in the correct order, normal urination
                happens.</p>
            <p><b>Penis.</b> The external reproductive organ of the male. The penis is made up of 2 parts, the shaft and
                the glans. The glans is the tip of the penis, while the shaft is the main part of the penis and contains
                the tube (urethra) that drains the bladder. All boys are born with a foreskin, or a covering over the
                tip of the penis. Some boys are circumcised. This means that this covering of skin is removed. Other
                boys are not circumcised and may have skin that covers the tip of the penis.</p>
